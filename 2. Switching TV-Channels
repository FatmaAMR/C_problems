/*2. Switching TV-Channels
time limit per test0.5 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes
inputstandard input
outputstandard output
Lisa's parents subscribed to a TV package containing N
 TV channels, numbered from 1
 to N
.

There are two buttons for switching channels on the remote control: "+
" and "−
".

A short press of button "+
" switches to the next channel, if the current channel number is less than N
. If the current channel number is equal to N
, the TV continues to show that channel. If the button "+
" is pressed and held for a while and the current TV-channel number is no more than N−K
, it will switch to K
 channels forward. Otherwise, a switch to channel N
 occurs.

Similarly, pressing the button "−
" shortly switches to the previous channel, if the current channel number is greater than 1
. If the current channel number equals 1
, the TV continues to show that channel. If the button "−
" is pressed and held for some time and the current channel number is greater than K
, it will switch to K
 channels backward. Otherwise, a switch to channel 1
 occurs.

When Lisa turned on the TV, channel P
 was on. Lisa knows that an interesting program will start soon on channel U
. Estimate the minimum number of button presses on the TV remote control that Lisa needs to make in order to switch the TV to channel U
.

Input
The first line contains an integer N
 (3≤N≤109
) which stands for the number of TV channels.

The second line contains an integer K
 (2≤K<N
), which is the number of channels which are switched backward or forward when holding the corresponding switch button on the TV-controller.

The third line contains an integer P
 (1≤P≤N
), which denotes the channel number that was on TV initially.

The fourth line contains an integer U
 (1≤U≤N
), which is the channel number that Lisa wants to switch to.

It should be assumed that P≠U
.

Output
You should output a single integer, which stands for the minimum number of times one should press the TV-controller buttons required to switch from channel P
 to channel U
.

Scoring
Solutions that run correctly for P<U
, N≤100
 score 24
 points.

Solutions that run correctly for N≤100
 score 48
 points.
